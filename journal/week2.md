# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

### Distributed Tracing
Distributed tracing is a method of tracking application requests as they flow from frontend devices to backend services and databases. Developers can use distributed tracing to troubleshoot requests that exhibit high latency or errors.
With this our focus will be on Observability.
Observability is the extent to which you can understand the internal state or condition of a complex system based only on knowledge of its external outputs.
Observability has three pillars whuch helps in analyzing and tracing events in our application which are  Logs, metrics and traces.

This week focuses on the use of some tool we will use to perform observability in our application
These tools are :
- Honeycomb
- AWS X-ray
- AWS Cloud watch logs
- Roll bar
