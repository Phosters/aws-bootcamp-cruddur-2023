# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Week 1 Summary
In Week one, I will be containerizing crudder app: 
1. I will first make sure that gitpod is connected to my github to leverage on gitpod's dev-as-service properties 
2. I will containerize the frontend with docker
3. After that, I will make sure that my backend is also containerized with docker
4. Next, I will use docker compose to manage multiple conatiner ie; the frontend and the backed end
5. Finally, I will Integrate app with a database

## Breakdown for 1:
### Reference: ![Link to reference](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/authentication/github)
1. I logged onto my Github repository and locted my Cruddur repo
2. Infront of my repo URL I inserted this ```gitpod.io/``` connecting my Github to Gitpod
3. I clicked on gipod to locate my workspace to see everything is fine in there
4. The entire Crudder app repo was there just like Github
