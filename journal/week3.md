# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

### Sign into AWS and configure cognito

### Creating user pool (user group)
Sign into AWS Console and open cognito, we will use user pools(but not the difference btn user pools and federated identities-allows third party IP)
Choose ``` username ``` and ``` email ``` as sign in option and then Next page
Choose the ``` password policy ``` type in our case we would choose the ``` defaults ```
In the Multi factor authenticator, choose ```no MFA ```
Under user account recovery choose only ``` Email ``` because of spend and allow users to ``` Enable self-service account recovery ```
Next, configure new users experience , allow users at sign up to ``` enable self registration ```
Attribute for verification should be set to ``` Email ```  and verify with ``` Email ``` becuase of cost
Required attributes should be set to ``` name ``` only and then Next Page
Configure message delivery with ``` Send email with Cognito ``` then choose AWS default email given and then Next
Now give user pool a name  with ``` cruddur-user-pool ``` and uncheck ``` Use the Cognito Hosted UI ``` and app type as ```public ``` and then name as ``` cruddur ``` and client secret as ``` Don't generate a client secret ``` an then Next Page 
Now click on ``` create user pool ```

### Install AWS Amplify(similar to GCP firebase) as a depency to login
locate your frontend and install aws amplify with this ``` npm i aws-amplify --save ```
